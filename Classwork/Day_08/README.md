# 🧮 Day 08 — Dynamic Memory & Optimization in C

### 📚 What I Learned Today

---

## I. 🧠 Dynamic Memory Allocation in C  
Practiced the complete lifecycle of dynamic memory:

### 1️⃣ Allocate the Memory  
Using `malloc()` to request memory from the heap.  

### 2️⃣ Use the Memory  
Accessing and modifying allocated memory using pointers.  

### 3️⃣ Free the Memory  
Releasing memory using `free()` to prevent memory leaks.

---

## II. 🔢 Problems on N Numbers  
Solved multiple problems involving arrays and loops, using dynamic memory to handle flexible input sizes.

---

## III. 🚫 Why Not to Write `return` Inside a Loop  
Understood that writing a `return` in a loop:  
- Stops the function immediately  
- Skips remaining iterations  
- Prevents full logic execution  
- Can cause incorrect output  

Learned to return only **after** the loop finishes.

---

## IV. 🧰 Memory Management in C (malloc)  
Explored how memory is allocated from the heap, how pointers handle it, and why proper cleanup is important for stable programs.

---

## V. 🚀 Code Optimization  
Reduced redundant logic, improved loop structure, and wrote cleaner, more efficient solutions.

---

📅 **Focus of the Day:** Understanding memory flow, avoiding premature returns, and building optimized, safe, and flexible C programs.
