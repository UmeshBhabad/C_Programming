# 🔢 Day 04 — Problem Solving with Numbers and Digits in C

### 📚 What I Learned Today
1. 🧮 **Problems on Numbers** — Practiced programs on factors, non-factors, counting them, and checking for prime numbers using optimized logic.  
2. ⚙️ **Code Optimization** — Focused on reducing time complexity and improving the efficiency of loops and conditions.  
3. 🚩 **Use of Flags** — Learned how to declare and update flags to track conditions (e.g., checking prime or non-prime states).  
4. 🔁 **Flag Declaration & Updation in Loops** — Used flags effectively inside `for` loops to manage logical states during iterations.  
5. 🔢 **Problems on Digits** — Solved problems involving digit extraction, summation, and manipulation of numbers.

📅 **Focus of the Day:** Strengthening logic building through number-based problems, efficient looping, and proper use of flags for controlled execution.
