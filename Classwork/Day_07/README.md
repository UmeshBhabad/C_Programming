### 📚 What I Learned Today

---

## I. 🧱 Array in C  
Understood how arrays store multiple values of the same type in contiguous memory and how they are used in programs.

---

## II. 📦 Static Array Declaration & Initialization  
Learned how to declare and initialize static arrays with fixed sizes at compile time.

---

## III. 🧠 Dynamic Array in C  
Explored how to create arrays at runtime based on user input or program requirements.

---

## IV. 🧰 Use of `malloc()`  
Practiced allocating memory dynamically using:
```c
ptr = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

---

## V. ⚙️ Dynamic Memory Allocation

Understood heap memory, proper allocation, reallocation, and releasing memory using free().

## VI. 🎯 Pointer in C

Learned how pointers store memory addresses, dereferencing pointers, and their role in dynamic arrays and functions.

## VII. 🔁 Pass by Value

Studied how C creates a copy of variables when passed to functions — meaning changes don’t affect original data.

## VIII. 🔗 Pass by Reference

Used pointers to pass addresses to functions so that original data can be modified inside the function.

## IX. 🔢 Problems on N Numbers

Solved logical problems involving loops, arrays, pointers, and memory allocation to process N values.

📅 Focus of the Day: Building a strong understanding of arrays, pointers, and memory management to write more flexible and powerful C programs.
