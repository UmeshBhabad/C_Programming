# 🔁 Day 03 — Enhancing Logic and Code Efficiency in C

### 📚 What I Learned Today
1. 🔄 **Using Loops for Iterations** — Applying `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops effectively to handle repetitive operations.  
2. 💡 **Improving Code with Better Approaches** — Exploring alternative methods to make programs more efficient and readable.  
3. ✅ **Using Boolean for Checks** — Implementing boolean logic to validate conditions and identify problem states in code.  
4. 🔁 **Understanding Looping Mechanisms** — Deep diving into loop flow control and avoiding infinite or redundant loops.  
5. ✂️ **Code Reduction** — Optimizing programs by eliminating unnecessary statements and simplifying logic.
