# 🚀 Day 02 — Writing Efficient and Structured Code in C

### 📚 What I Learned Today
1. ⚙️ **Using Functions for Business Logic** — Organizing code into reusable, well-defined functions.  
2. ✅ **Using Boolean Return Type** — Returning true/false values to make logical decisions clearer.  
3. ✂️ **Code Reduction** — Simplifying redundant code to improve readability and maintainability.  
4. 🔁 **Using Loops for Iterations** — Implementing `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops to handle repetitive tasks.  
5. 🧮 **Dry Running Code** — Manually tracing the code to predict output and catch logical errors early.  
6. 🏷️ **Proper Naming of Functions and Variables** — Following meaningful and consistent naming conventions for better understanding.
